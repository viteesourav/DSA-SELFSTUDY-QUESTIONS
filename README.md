# DSA-SELFSTUDY-QUESTIONS

This Repo Consists of Topic wise list of questions.
Coding languge: C++
Questions Reference: GFG Practise.

- As a part of This Repo, I will include my practise of mostly asked topic wise questions in DSA.
- Questions will not be named outside, So just open a random File and try to see if you know how to solve the problems.
- More will be added to this repo once we start working through other problems.
- Each topics will contain a mixture of Easy to Medium level Problems that more likely to get in an Actualy Interview.
- The Files will not contains the entire code, It will just contains the algorithm and the approach you suppose to follow.

Happy practise Coding !
All the Best :)
